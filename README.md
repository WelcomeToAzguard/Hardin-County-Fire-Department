We ran into many problems through CSS. We would get one thing figured out then another would appear when we tried
sometjing else most of the time. We have had the main problem was with the pictures and font size.
I  figured out the font problem after a few days. 

The pictures ended up not going in the middle no matter how many times we asked for helped and searched for different ways to get it in the middle.


CSS was the main challenge forus, we kept running into error after error. We have most of them fixed. The pictures still won't center align. The font size was finally fixed after figuring out that em needed to go right beside the the number. 

It is not all there but it still works as if it is there. 

It is not mobile friendly. 

HTML was quite easy. I believe there was only one problem with the html that we fixed other than the parts that aren't there.
